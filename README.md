# flight_delay (Devt progress)
Delay is one of the most known performance indicators of any transportation system. It has many negative impacts and as I focus on flight data analytics, I think that Flight Delay prediction is crucial and quite important in commercial aviation.


# TIME SERIES DATA
I thought of encoding the time-series data with their respective timestamp embeddings[x] to a fixed size vector representation [s].


# TEMPORAL FEATURES

GRAM Matrix structure
- A good 2D representation for univariate time-series data
- Gram matrix dot.product fail to represent data for LSTM
- I need an operation that can make GRAM matrix structure ready for neural network

GRAM matrix is a useful tool in linear algrebra and Geometry
- Set on n-vectors is a matrix defined by a dot product.

- Gram matrix preserves temporal dependency. Time increases as the position moves from top-left to bottom-right , the time dimension is encoded into the geometry of the matrix.
